# Sahayak - ASHA worker Companion
ðŸš€ Live Demo: [Sahayak - ASHA Worker Companion](https://harsh-sahayak.streamlit.app/]


Sahayak is a Streamlit-based application designed to assist ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers in India. 
I developed a custom vector database by processing the official PDFs and guideline documents provided by government sources for ASHA workers. 
Using advanced embedding techniques, the documents were transformed into a structured, searchable knowledge base, enabling accurate and context-aware responses. This ensures that all information is sourced from authoritative government material rather than general internet data, making the system reliable, precise, and fully aligned with official guidelines.[Go to Government Health Resources](https://nhm.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&level=3&sublinkid=184&lid=257)



## Features
